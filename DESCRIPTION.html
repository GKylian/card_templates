Allows you to create <b>card templates</b> that you can pick in the editor in <i>juste 2 keystrokes</i>. This is especially useful if you create a lot of cards with a similar layout: you don't need to copy/paste fields anymore.
<b>Important: </b> Cards are grouped by note type, so for example you can't use a <i>Cloze</i> card template when <i>Basic</i> is selected in the editor.


<b>HOW TO USE A TEMPLATE: </b> in the editor, click on the template button (or use the shortcut: <b>Ctrl+T</b> by default). Navigate between templates with the up/down arrow keys, filter them by name. <b>Apply the selected template</b> with <b>Enter</b> (or the choose button).

<b>HOW TO ADD A TEMPLATE: </b> in the editor, fill in the fields and create the template that you want. Open the template menu and click on the 'Add card as template' button. It will prompt you for the name of the template.

<b>HOW TO DELETE A TEMPLATE: </b> <i>select the template</i> you want to delete in the template menu and click on the <i>Delete select</i> button.

<b>BUGS / HELP / SUGGESTIONS: </b>

<b>DO NOT</b> use reviews for bug reports or support requests as I don't get notified. Preferably create a new issue on the <a href="">github repository</a> (you need a github account) or send me an email at mynnhos0@gmail.com (<b>please include</b> any error shown, your anki version as well as your operating system).
Suggestions are fine here but I'm more likely to see them on github or by email.
